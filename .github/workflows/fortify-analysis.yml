# Reusable workflow file for running Fortify on Demand SAST & Debricked scans if the following secrets are available:
# - OSS_FOD_TENANT
# - OSS_FOD_USER
# - OSS_FOD_PASSWORD
# These secrets are managed at github.com/fortify/fortify organization level, but may need to be granted access to for
# repositories that need to be scanned, and pull requests generated from forks will not have access to those secrets.
# In such cases, the FoD scan will be skipped without errors.
